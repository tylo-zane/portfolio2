        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>Google is a powerful organization:</p>
        <ul class="reg-list">
          <li><p>the Google account has become a universal login for the internet</p></li>
          <li><p>the ‘Big Four’ company boasts ownership to the bestselling brand of 
                mobile phone (Schmidt, 2018)</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4>The Problem</h4>
        <p>Google’s business model relies on collecting user data in order to ‘personalize’ ads.
          However, several issues arise from Google’s methods of data collection, including:</p>
        <ul class="reg-list">
          <li><p>Excessive colletion of personal data</p></li>
          <li><p>Deceptive management options of what gets collected</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
        <p>The Google Activity Manager app is a renovated platform to manage the personal data
           collected by Google. It allows users to selectively share, delete, or anonymize data.</p>

        <h3 id="research">Research</h3>
        <h4>Excessive Data Collection</h4>
        <p>The sheer amount of personal data that Google collects is overwhelming.</p>
        <ul class="reg-list">
          <li><p>Researchers found that an Android phone which was inactive for 24 hours sent 900 
                 data samples to Google. Over ⅓ of the samples contained location data (Sutton, 2018)</p></li>
          <li><p>An Android phone in airplane mode was found to have collected 
                 over 100 location markers in the course of the user’s day, each of these markers 
                 containing an accurate description of the user’s actions at the time (Getting out 
                 of a car, running, etcetera) (Novikos, 2018)</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Deceptive Data Management</h4>
        <p>The current version of Google’s “My Activity” creates a disconnect between what users expect buttons
           to do and what the buttons actually do. Ultimately, this forfeits the user’s feeling of being in-control.</p>
        <ul class="reg-list">
          <li><p>Location data is hidden behind the “Other Google Activity” menu. Upon searching for his 
                 location data, Ryan Nakashima of Associated Press could not find the ‘View Timeline” feature— 
                 Google’s intended way for users to view their location data in one, convenient map (2018).</p></li>
          <img src="img/am-example-1.png" alt="High fidelity mockup displaying functionality of">
          <li><p>Although it is possible to prevent the tech-giant from recording any and all location markers,
                 this setting is locked behind a less obvious option called “Web & App Activity”. 
                 A “Location History” setting does exist, but alas, turning Location History off doesn’t 
                 actually stop Google from recording location history (Dreyfuss, 2018).</p></li>
          <img src="img/am-example-2.png" alt="High fidelity mockup displaying functionality of">
          <li><p>Deleting activity from the site does not guarantee that the information is gone 
                 from Google’s servers. Instead, in an action called ‘anonymization’, Google strips 
                 deleted data of all identifying information and keeps it in their records. </p></li>

        <p>The following are examples of some of the rennovations we've made which set our
          app apart from Google's official "My Activity" platform. To view a list of all rennovations,

        <h4>Viewing Activity</h4>
        <div class="side">
          <img src="img/am-view.png" alt="High fidelity mockup displaying functionality of">
          <ul class="reg-list">
            <li><p>Our Location Map (Figure B) is redesigned to be clearly linked at the 
                top of the page.</p></li>
            <li><p>RATIONALE: We among others at the Associated Press  could not easily find our location
                data while using ‘My Activity’--  it was unintuitively hidden behind side tab ”Other Activity”. 
                (Nakashima, 2018). </p></li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <h4>Deleting Data</h4>
        <div class="side">
          <img src="img/am-delete.png" alt="High fidelity mockup displaying functionality of">
          <ul class="reg-list">
            <li><p>With the new ‘draw tool’ (Figure B), mass deleting location data has never been easier. 
                   Users can simply lasso the location markers they wish to delete.</p></li>
            <li><p>RATIONALE: During user testing, users thought they should be able to mass delete data by location.</p></li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <h4>Data Quantity Slider</h4>
        <div class="side">
          <img src="img/am-quantity.png" id="quantity" alt="High fidelity mockup displaying functionality of">
          <ul class="reg-list">
            <li><p>The user can control the exact quantity of data that gets collected on 
                them per 24-hour period. Activity Manager will prioritize certain types of
                data over others to ensure that the defined limit is never exceeded.</p></li>
            <li><p>RATIONALE: This feature is a direct response to an experiment where
                   an inactive Android was carried around for an entire day. It was later 
                   revealed to have sent over 900 data samples in that period, and over a third 
                   contained location data. (Sutton, 2018).</p></li>
